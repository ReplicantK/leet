# Leet

This repository contains a collection of my solutions to LeetCode-style coding questions.
The problems I have solved are sourced from platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and other similar websites.

## Project Structure

This repository follows a simple structure:

* src/
  * solution1.cpp
  * solution2.cpp
  * ...
  * solutionN.cpp

The `src` directory contains multiple .cpp files, each representing a solution to an individual problem.

## Running

To compile and run a `.cpp` file using `g++`, follow these steps:

1. Using a terminal or command prompt navigate to the `src` directory after cloning this repo.
2. Compile the desired `.cpp` file using `g++` by running the following command: `g++ -std=c++20 input_filename.cpp -o output_filename`
    * Replace `input_filename` with the desired problem you want to run from the `src` directory and `output_filename`
with the desired name for the compiled executable.
3. After succesfully compiling, simply run the compiled executable with the following command: `./output_filename`
